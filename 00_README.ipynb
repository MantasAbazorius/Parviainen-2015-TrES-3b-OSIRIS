    "# TrES-3b transmission spectroscopy with the OSIRIS@GTC\n",
    "\n",
    "These IPython notebooks and Python codes reproduce the transmission spectroscopy study of the OSIRIS-observed TrES-3b transit described in Parviainen et al. (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis can be reproduced by following the IPython notebooks in their numbered order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Naturally, these notebooks don't quite represent the actual analysis process as it was (which included trying out different ideas, trial and error, and several facepalms), but are a cleaned-up version of the final analysis presented in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses the normal set of scientific python packages easily available from pip and other sources\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](www.python.org), [NumPy](www.numpy.org), [SciPy](www.scipy.org), [PyFITS](www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits), [IPython](http://ipython.org), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org), [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn), [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee), [George](http://dan.iel.fm/george)\n",
    "\n",
    "and a set of packages available from [github](https://github.com/hpparvi)\n",
    "\n",
    "    PyTransit, PyDE, PyLDTk, PyFC, PyExoTK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data/spectra`: Spectra reduced by Grzegorz Nowak\n",
    "- `data/arc`: Arc frames for wavelength calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`001_Wavelength_calibration.ipynb`**\n",
    "- **`002_Light_curve_creation.ipynb`**\n",
    "- **`003a_bb_wn.ipynb`**: broadband analysis assuming white noise.\n",
    "- **`003b_bb_rn.ipynb`**: broadband analysis assuming red noise modelled as a Gaussian process.\n",
    "- **`004a`**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executable scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parts of the analysis are done using executable python scripts found under the `scripts` directory. These are tasks that usually take for a while to run, and for which the use of a notebook would not add much value. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `fit_color.py`: Basic narrow-band parameter estimation\n",
    "- `fit_color_dw.py`: DW narrow-band parameter estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The log-posterior functions (implemented as callable classes) are stored in separate python modules with names `lpf_xx.py`, where `xx` identifies the type of the function. These are\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lpf_ww`: broadband (white) with white noise\n",
    "- `lpf_wr`: broadband with red noise\n",
    "- `lpf_nw`: narrow band with white noise\n",
    "- `lpf_nd`: simultaneoud broad- and narrow-band modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intermediate results\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavelength solutions are stored as Python pickles in `results/wavelength_calibration.pkl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The light curves are stored as Pandas dataframes in a structured HDF5 file in `results/light_curves.h5`. The file is organised as\n",
    "\n",
    "- `aux`\n",
    "- `filters`\n",
    "- `final/XX_YYYYYY`\n",
    "- `target/XX_YYYYYY`\n",
    "- `reference/XX_YYYYYY`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `XX` is either `bb` for broadband for `nb` narrow-band, and `YYYYYY` is either `nomask` or `masked`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final results\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw MCMC chains and DE results are stored in separate `.npz` files in the `results` directory. Pandas dataframes for each run are stored in a single HDF5 file in the `results` directory.\n",
